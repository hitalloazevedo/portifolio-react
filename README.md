# My Portfolio Website

This project is a improvement from my first portfolio website, a rebuild. It was built in [ReactJs](https://react.dev/), and the inspiration was the old website, I choose for mantain the essence, though, now in background is running nowadays technologies... Using [React](https://react.dev/) I was able to solve some bugs that the native Javascript had, such as an almost perfect implementation of [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/), as well as a component implementation built by me, `TypeWriter`.
